    <h2>All about Grilled Charlie</h2>
    <P>Charlie Kelly's "go-to" sandwich he makes on his hot plate or, in a pinch, the radiator...</P>
    <p>In Charlie's words: "What are you doing? Do Not put peanut butter on that. No! Peanut Butter outside, chocolate inside...butter inside, cheese outside."</p>
    <p>This is a great snack/meal if you don't have enough money in your budget this week for milksteak with a side of the finest jellybeans.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wonder Bread</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter (creamy) </li>
        <li>American Cheese singles</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Hershey's Chocolate Syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, spray a saute pan very liberally with Pam or similar cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Over medium heat, place 2 slices of cheese in the pan, followed by a buttered slice of white bread (buttered side should be facing UP).</li>
        <li>Heat for 2 minutes or a bit longer, being careful not to burn the cheese (this may take a little experimenting depending on how hot the pan is).</li>
        <li>Next, drizzle or squirt Hershey's chocolate sauce on top of that BEFORE placing another slice of white bread also buttered on one side (again, buttered side facing up) on top.</li>
